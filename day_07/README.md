# Day 7: Preventing Customer Churn with Feature Engineering

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the power of feature engineering in machine learning by building and comparing customer churn prediction models for a telecommunications company. The analysis showcases how thoughtfully engineered features can impact model performance and provides a comprehensive exploration of feature selection techniques and model optimization.

## Objective

To demonstrate the importance of feature engineering by building and comparing three models: a baseline model using raw features, an enhanced model with custom-engineered features, and optimized models with feature selection. The goal is to accurately predict customer churn and understand the impact of different feature engineering approaches.

## Dataset Information

- **Source**: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv)
- **Size**: 7,043 customers with 21 features
- **Target Variable**: Customer churn (binary classification)
- **Key Features**: Customer demographics, account information, services subscribed, and billing details
- **Churn Distribution**: Approximately 26.5% churn rate (class imbalance present)

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
- Loaded telecommunications customer dataset (7,043 records, 21 features)
- Examined dataset structure, dimensions, and data types
- Identified data quality issues (TotalCharges as object type with spaces)
- Analyzed target variable distribution and class imbalance

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Data Type Corrections**: Converted TotalCharges from object to numeric, handling spaces
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Filled missing TotalCharges values with 0
- **Categorical Simplification**: Standardized "No internet service" and "No phone service" to "No"
- **Data Validation**: Ensured consistency across all features

### 3. Feature Engineering Techniques

#### Core Engineered Features
- **`tenure_group`**: Binned tenure into meaningful categories:
  - 0-1 Year, 1-2 Years, 2-4 Years, 4-5 Years, 5+ Years
- **`num_add_services`**: Count of additional services (OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies)
- **`monthly_charge_ratio`**: MonthlyCharges divided by (tenure + 1) to avoid division by zero

#### Advanced Feature Engineering (Assignment)
- **Customer Value Features**: `avg_monthly_charges`, `charges_per_service`
- **Service Engagement**: `total_services`, `service_penetration`
- **Contract Features**: `contract_length_months`, `payment_convenience`
- **Risk Indicators**: `high_risk_payment`, `new_high_charges`
- **Demographic Interactions**: `senior_complex_services`, `family_account`
- **Internet Quality**: `fiber_streaming`, `security_conscious`
- **Stability Metrics**: `tenure_stability`, `charges_outlier`

### 4. Model Development and Comparison

#### Three-Model Comparison Approach
1. **Baseline Model**: Original features with Logistic Regression
2. **Enhanced Model**: Engineered features with Logistic Regression
3. **Feature Selection Model**: Selected features using Random Forest importance

#### Advanced Assignment Implementation

- **Feature Selection Methods**: Random Forest importance, RFE, Mutual Information, Chi-squared
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid Search CV with F1-score optimization

### 5. Feature Selection Exploration
- **Random Forest Feature Importance**: Median threshold selection
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: 15, 20, 25 features
- **Mutual Information**: Top 15, 20, 25 features
- **Chi-squared Test**: Statistical feature selection
- **Performance Impact Analysis**: Comparison across selection methods
